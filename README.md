# Threaded_File_Management_System

Persistent Data:
The Threaded File Management System already contains some folders & files present in the DATA file. It maintains
persistent data. Each time the program is run, new folders & files are automatically stored in the DATA file, which
gets loaded into the program in the next run.

To execute any function write the function's name along with its proper syntax in any thread file. Select the number 
of threads in the program's menu, and you are good to go!

NOTE: Don't forget to call the "show_memory_map" function to store the new files & folders in the DATA file
